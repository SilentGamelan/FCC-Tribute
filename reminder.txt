- Adjust poembox margins to % to give some leeway when resizing screen
    need text in boxes to shift to left - seems like english and trans of
    poem
    have hanging margin thats pushing the kanji float out of flow

- Make sure image is also resizing
- adjust semantic tags in float version.

* Finish refactoring grid version
- see if able to recreate custom bullet points in grid version
- try to use flex boxes for spacing sidebars?

* Correct styling to avoid need to use bootstrap
    - currently text looks wrong without it
        font?
        font-size - likely
        line-height - likely (see bootstrap changes list on w3schools
* see if possible to eliminate jquery
