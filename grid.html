              <p> An 18th Century Japanese beggar-monk and a legendary Haiku poet.</p>
              <p>Comedic, yet devout; A wry commentor on the minutiae and burdens of life and a lover of the (often literal) underdog.</p>

              <p>A person who saw and wrote only about the beauty and wistful nature of reality, even as he experienced it's most testing difficulties and pains.</p>

              <p>Giving himself the pen-name "Issa" (meaning literally "a cup of tea") is a deep reflection of his humility, humour, and compassion. Tea being a simple pleasure that is shared by peasants and kings, offered in hospitality to visitors, and even
                during the Japanese tea ceremony, <a href="https://youtu.be/IFDkcvrSaYU" target="tea">cha-no-yu</a> <span class="matcha">(抹茶)</span>, a source of introspection and meditation.</p>

              <p>In Japan, Haiku has a long and voluminous history, but of it's many practitioners, the "Great Four" are held as the masters of this paper art:<br>
                Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki</p>

              <p>Haiku in the west typically only gives a single name; "Basho" - eternally crosslegged beside his splashing frog's <a href="http://www.oldpondcomics.com/characters.html" target="splash">pond</a>. In Japan, Basho remains highly respected, but
                yet it is more often Issa that is beloved beyond admiration of his technical skills.</p>

              <p>For who else would stop to immortalize in words their worry about the marital status of a <a href="#duck" rel="" id="anchor1" class="anchorLink">lonely duck</a>, or a cheerful warning to a toad about an imminent <a href="#shower">golden shower</a>,
                or his admiration of his dog's <a href="#hat">new hat</a>? To share his compassion for all creatures, even the <a href="#fly">pests</a> of the world, the beauty inherent in even the most <a href="#cat">base</a> things, and his perception
                that at its core the world still contains hope even in the midst of <a href="#dew">death</a></p>

                    <p>1763: The year that saw Johnson meet Boswell in a bookshop nestled in the swirling streets of London, and the conclusion of the Seven Years War that tilted the balances of power between the European colonial nations.</p>
                    <p>It also witnessed the birth of a farmer's boy in Kashiwabara village, Shinano Province, Japan - Kobayashi Yatarō (小林 弥太郎).</p>
                    <p>Later to be remembered as the legendary, yet always humble, poet:</p>

                  <li>1765: The first of many misfortunes to befall Issa; his mother dies. He is three years old.</li>
                  <li>1776: As Thomas Paine mused that "These are the times that try men's souls" amidst the birth-pains of the fledgling American nation, hardship and tragedy continue to follow the boy Issa.<br> His Grandmother, who had doted on him since
                    his mother's death, also dies.<br> Issa becomes a lonely child wandering the fields, estranged from his home by a disapproving step-mother.</li>

                  <li>1777-1787: At the age of 15, the young Issa sets off on a journey, ostensibly to Edo (present-day Tokyo). This period of his life is something of a mystery; from the point of view of history, he simply disappears from record.</li>

                  <li>1787: Issa is listed in the records of a Haiku school in Edo, under Master Chikua.</li>

                  <li>1792-97: Issa wanders the islands of Japan, from Shikoku to Kyushu. He visits Nagasaki, Matsuyama, and finally Fukuyama, writing poetry wherever he goes.</li>

                  <li>1801: He returns again to his home village. During this stay, His father passes away. Long and bitter legal arguments begin over his father's inheritance. Issa again wanders, eventually arriving in the capital.</li>

                  <li>1812: He leaves Edo to live in his native village of Kashiwabara.</li>

                  <li>1814: At age 52, he marries 28 year old Kiku, named after the crysanthemum flower.<br> In Japan, it is the seasonal flower of September, as well as being a symbol of longevity and of the Emperor himself.
                    <br>White crysanthemum is also a symbol of death; another touch of fate's irony in Issa's life.
                  </li>

                  <li>1816: His first son, Sentarô, is born. Less than a month later, he dies.</li>

                  <li>1818: Kiku gives birth to a daughter, Sato.</li>

                  <li>1819: Sato dies of smallpox. From this year to 1821, Issa writes haiku in Hachiban nikki ("Eighth Diary").</li>

                  <li>1820: His second son, Ishitarô, is born.</li>

                  <li>1821: Ishitarô suffocates while bundled on his mother's back.</li>

                  <li>1822: Issa's third son, Konzaburô, is born.<br> From this year until 1825, Issa writes haiku in Bunsei kuchô ("Bunsei Era Haiku Notebook").</li>

                  <li>1823: His wife, Kiku, dies at the age of 35. Issa is 61.<br> Later that year, Konzaburô also passes away.</li>

                  <li>1824: Issa marries Yuki, a samurai's daughter (age 38), divorcing only 3 months later.<br> In the autumn Issa suffers a stroke, losing his power of speech for a while.</li>

                  <li>1827: A fire sweeps through Kashiwabara village during the summer, destroying Issa's house.<br> He moves into a grain barn on his property that survived the fire.</li>

                  <li>1828: Issa's Death, caused by a stroke, January 5.</li>
